  <p class="about-p">
    World today has moved to digital era. Websites are primary source of information.
    I developed this website on Yoga and Ayurveda, which are ancient source for human well-being.
    To design a website, I scrutinised a number of websites, their designs to have an idea about the designing pattern of the website.
    I then drew several design on paper and finalise the design which suits my topic and content. Designing website was a wonderful experience
    for me and during that phase I figured out that designing a good website is not an easy task. A good design comes from good implementation of the design principles.
    Therefore, of the good design principles are avoiding the use inline styles for CSS, because when the size of the website increases, it gets difficult to make
     changes in it. So instead of using inline CSS, a good practice is to use external stylesheet and embed it in the head of your HTML document.
     I tested my website on a number of web browser like Google Chrome, Safari and Firefox, to ensure that website’s UI is working fine in all the browser and there
     is no breakage in the design, we should start testing at an earlier phase in the development lifecycle, waiting to the end will increase the size of code and makes
     difficult to fix everything in the end. Get your content proof read from your friends as they can easily figure out mistakes in your work as compared to you.
</p>
<p class="about-p">I learned lot about the website designing in this course, since we have to design this website from scratch. If I had knowledge about web designing
   earlier I would have followed proper naming convention i.e. assigning a name to the web page that starts from lowercase, as it gets annoying to make changes
   and also possess difficulty whenever we need to reference that page in some other HTML page. Web designing also helped me for my computing project and I used the bootstrap
   template which made the designing easier. It gave me a feeling that we could have used something like that in our website that would be easy and we could have made website
   more interactive and interesting. W3C school and code academy helped me learn about the concepts and stack overflow helped me overcome the errors and issues that I faced during the development.
</p>
<p class="about-p">
  I also used JavaScript in the third task of the assignment, where I had to make an alternate CSS. I used the script to add a feature to my website that is to make it printer-friendly.
   The script that I have used is changing the website page from normal mode to printer mode and then back to the normal version. I realized that it would have been great, if I had used
   JavaScript earlier as well so that I could have added some more features to it the web page and make it more attractive and interactive.In the end, I would like to summarize by saying
    that this was a very helpful and interesting course and it also helped me to know how the human computer interaction is closely related to the web designing. I feel that the aspects
    that I came to know through this course will definitely help me to succeed in the real time industry.
